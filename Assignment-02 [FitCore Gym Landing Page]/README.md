## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Apply external CSS linking, proper syntax, and use comments to organize stylesheets effectively.  
- Implement basic selectors (`*`, `tagName`, `.class`, `#id`) with correct specificity and cascade control.  
- Use box model properties — `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `border`, and `border-radius` — to create clean layouts with proper `box-sizing`.  
- Master display properties: `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block` while understanding replaced vs non-replaced elements.  
- Utilize `float` and `clear` effectively for layout and content positioning.  
- Apply text and font properties (`text-transform`, `line-height`, `font-weight`, etc.) for polished visual presentation.  
- Structure content with semantic HTML and use `<div>` and `<span>` appropriately for layout and inline styling.
