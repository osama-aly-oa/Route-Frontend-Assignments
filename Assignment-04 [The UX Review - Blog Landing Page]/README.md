## 🎯 Learning Objectives  

- Build a complete, responsive blog landing page using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
- Implement complex multi-column layouts using **Flexbox** (`display: flex`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-wrap`).  
- Apply **media queries** for responsiveness across all screen sizes.  
- Use `box-sizing: border-box` to simplify layout calculations and ensure consistent sizing.  
- Utilize CSS **positioning** (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`) and `z-index` for layered and sticky elements.  
- Enhance interactivity with **pseudo-classes** (`:hover`) and **pseudo-elements** (`::before`, `::after`).  
- Add smooth **transitions** and **transforms** for dynamic hover animations.
