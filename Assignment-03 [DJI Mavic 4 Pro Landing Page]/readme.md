## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

### 🧩 Mastering HTML Structure
- Build a well-organized HTML document using `<div>` and `<span>` elements.  
- Apply classes and IDs for styling — no semantic HTML5 tags used.  

### 🧱 Complex Flex-Based Layouts
- Create multi-column hero, accessories, and footer sections using **flexbox**.  

### 🧭 Advanced Positioning & Stacking
- Use `position: relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed` to layer elements.  
- Apply `z-index` to manage stacking contexts (e.g., sticky navbar, badges).  

### 📦 Box Model Proficiency
- Master `margin`, `padding`, and `border` for precise element sizing.  
- Understand margin-collapse and its impact on layout.  

### 🎨 Advanced Styling Techniques
- Add interactivity with pseudo-classes (`:hover`) on buttons and cards.  
- Use pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for decorative UI details.  

### ⚙️ Dynamic Interactions with Transitions & Transforms
- Implement smooth hover effects using `transition`.  
- Apply `transform: scale()` for engaging animations.  

### 🖋 Typography and Backgrounds
- Create a clear typographic hierarchy using font and text properties.  
- Use background properties effectively for section styling.
